# VR Science Lab: Explore Chemistry and Biology in Virtual Reality

Welcome to the **VR Science Lab**, an immersive virtual reality experience designed to simulate key experiments in chemistry and biology. This application provides a safe, engaging, and interactive environment for students and educators to explore scientific concepts without the need for physical supplies or cleanup.

## **Features**
### **Experiments Included**
1. **Frog Dissection (Biology)**  
   - Perform virtual dissections to learn about anatomy and physiology.
   - Explore organs and systems in a detailed 3D environment.

2. **Titration (Chemistry)**  
   - Conduct virtual titration experiments to understand acid-base reactions.
   - Practice precise measurements and observe chemical changes.

3. **Spectral Flame Analysis (Chemistry)** 
   - Analyze the colors produced by various chemical compounds when exposed to flame.
   - Learn about electron excitation and energy levels.

## **How to Run the Application**
### **System Requirements**
- VR Headset: Oculus Quest 2, HTC Vive, or any OpenXR-compatible device.
- Operating System: Windows 10/11 or macOS (with VR support).
- Unity Version: Built with Unity 2022.3 LTS.

### **Installation Steps**
1. **Download the Application**:
   - Clone the repository or download the `.zip` file containing the project build.
2. **Deploy to Headset**:
   - For Meta Quest devices:
     - Connect your headset via USB.
     - Use Oculus Developer Hub or `adb` commands to install the `.apk` file.
   - For PC-based VR:
     - Run the `.exe` file directly from your computer.

3. **Launch**:
   - Put on your VR headset and start the application from your library.

## **Testing the Application**
### **Testing Environment**
- Ensure your VR headset is properly connected and configured.
- Recommended testing space: 2m x 2m for free movement.

### **Steps to Test**
1. Launch the application and navigate through the main menu.
2. Select an experiment (currently only Flame Analysis):
   - Frog Dissection: Follow step-by-step instructions for dissection tasks.
   - Titration: Adjust burette controls and observe color changes.
   - Spectral Flame Analysis: Place compounds in flames and analyze emitted colors.
3. Interact with tools and objects using VR controllers.
4. Verify functionality:
   - Ensure smooth interactions with objects.
   - Check for accurate experiment results (e.g., titration endpoint detection).

## **Known Issues**
- Some interactions may require recalibration if tracking is inconsistent.
- Ensure OpenXR runtime is properly set up if using a PC-based VR system.
- Not all functions work, Currently only the Spectral Analysis is available.
